Categorizr is a modern device detection script that helps categorize different web-capable devices into four categories: mobile, tablet, tv and desktop. It takes traditional device detection and flips it on its head, assuming devices are mobile unless otherwise detected.

## Usage

After installation, frontend pages will have a parameter called `devicecategorizr` added to the parameter pool with one of the following values:

 * mobile
 * tablet
 * tv
 * desktop
